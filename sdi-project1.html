<p>Martial arts has been an interest for me since I was a child. 
My father introduced me to martial arts when I was only 9 years old and I have been doing 
this ever since. I have won over 100 tournaments in the last 30 years and I have earned 5 
different style black belts along the way. Some styles I master are 
Goju Ryu, Judo, Aikido, Shinkendo, and several styles of Kempo.</p>
<p>I started teaching martial arts when I was 16 and my first style was Goju Ryu. 
For those who don't know the style, this is Chuck Norris' martial art style. Rumors say 
that Chuck Norris was one of the only Martial Artists that was able to beat Bruce Lee 
in a match. It is the base martial art of Ninjutsu which is the style of the Ninjas.</p>
<p>I stopped teaching martial arts 5 years ago when I decided to retire from the sport.
Now I only teach it to my kids. I have been offered to continue teaching, but I haven't 
reached a decision yet. I did martial arts as a hobby only but because I was good at it, 
it became more of a job than a hobby. Maybe my son will continue my legacy. He is already 
a black belt and he really enjoys the sport.</p>
